### ToDos For Later:

- set a user timeout to prevent message spamming
- write tests for once

### How to use the Bot for Yourself
[Directions here.]
- Create an app-settings.json
	```json
	{
		"allowed_channel": "xenecraft-‚õè",
		"bot_reponse_color": "<yourColorHere>",
		"bot_token": "<yourDiscordToken>",
		"broadcast_channel_id": "<channelYouWantOnlineOfflineMessagesToBeSentTo>",
		"prefix": "<yourPrefixHere>"
	}
	```
- Create a constants.js file
	```json
	const APP_CONSTANTS = {
		API_URL: `https://api.mcsrvstat.us/2/`,
		API_FALLBACK_URL: `https://mcapi.us/server/status?ip=`,
		GITHUB_URL: `https://github.com/Xenecraft/Xene-Mine-Bot`,
		REFRESH_INTERVAL: 600000, //10 minutes, be careful as you don't want to get blocked for spamming the API
		SERVER_NAME: `Xenecraft`,
		SERVER_PORT: `25565`, //You may not need to use this if you have a standard MC port like 25565
		SERVER_URL: `play.xenecraft.com`,
		SITE_URL: `http://xenecraft.com`,
	};
	module.exports = APP_CONSTANTS;
	```
- `npm run index.js` or `nodemon index` locally or in your instance
